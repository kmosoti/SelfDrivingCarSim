# Self-Driving Car with JavaScript Simulation
This is my JavaScript project that utilizes a neural networks and machine learning to create a Self Driving Car simulation

This project was built following a tutorial made by [Dr. Radu Mariescu-Istodor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs_rAxEsAvI&list=LL&index=4&t=3311s)
